# WindowsFacts
An API to get Windows Facts. This is written in PowerShell using AWS Lambda / API Gateway.


## Description
This is a project for an API to deliver Windows Facts... really for entertainment.  I have been wanting to build an API using PowerShell and AWS Lambda for awhile now. I got this working in a few hours. It is far from perfect. This is mostly going to be a place for me to get better at CI/CD, AWS and testing. I am hopeful the community will submit PRs to add more facts! ðŸ˜ƒ

Thanks to [Josh Rickard](https://github.com/MSAdministrator) for the idea!

## Examples
